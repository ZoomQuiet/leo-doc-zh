<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Beginnings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#beginnings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo grew out of my efforts to use Donald Knuth&#8217;s &#8220;CWEB system of Structured
documentation.&#8221; I had known of literate programming since the mid 1980&#8217;s, but I
never understood how to make it work for me. In November 1995 I started thinking
about programming in earnest. Over the holidays I mused about making programs
more understandable. In January 1996 the fog of confusion suddenly cleared. I
summarized my thinking with the phrase, <strong>web are outlines in disguise</strong>. I
suspected that outline views were the key to programming, but many details
remained obscure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="breakthrough">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Breakthrough</a><a class="headerlink" href="#breakthrough" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>March 5, 1996, is the most important date in Leo&#8217;s history. While returning from
a day of skiing, I discussed my thoughts with Rebecca. During that conversation
I realized that I could use the MORE outliner as a prototype for a &#8220;programming
outliner.&#8221; I immediately started work on my first outlined program. It quickly
became apparent that outlines work: all my old problems with programming
vanished. The &#64;others directive dates from this day. I realized that MORE&#8217;s
outlines could form the basis for Leo&#8217;s screen design. Rather than opening body
text within the outline, as MORE does, I decided to use a separate body pane.</p>
<p>I hacked a translator called M2C which allowed me to use MORE to write
real code. I would write code in MORE, copy the text to the clipboard in
MORE format, then run M2C, which would convert the outline into C code.
This process was useful, if clumsy. I called the language used in the outline
SWEB, for simplified CWEB. Much later Leo started supporting the noweb
language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="apple-and-yellowbox">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Apple and YellowBox</a><a class="headerlink" href="#apple-and-yellowbox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout 1996 I created a version of Leo on the Macintosh in plain C and the
native Mac Toolbox. This was a poor choice; I wasted a huge amount of time
programming with these primitive tools. However, this effort convinced me that
Leo was a great way to program.</p>
<p>Late in 1997 I wrote a Print command to typeset an outline. Printing (Weaving)
is supposedly a key feature of literate programming. Imagine my surprise when I
realized that such a &#8220;beautiful&#8221; program listing was almost unintelligible; all
the structure inherent in the outline was lost! I saw clearly that typesetting,
no matter how well done, is no substitute for explicit structure.</p>
<p>In 1998 I created a version of Leo using Apple&#8217;s YellowBox environment. Alas,
Apple broke its promises to Apple developers. I had to start again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="borland-c">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Borland C++</a><a class="headerlink" href="#borland-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I rewrote Leo for Borland C++ starting in May 1999. Borland C++ was much better
than CodeWarrior C, but it was still C++. This version of Leo was the first
version to use xml as the format of .leo files. The last version of Borland Leo,
3.12 Final went out the door July 17, 2003.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discovering-python">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Discovering Python</a><a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I attended the Python conference in early 2001. In May of 2000 I began work on
an wxWindows version of Leo. This did not work out, but something good did come
from this effort. I spent a lot of time adding Python scripting to the wxWindows
code and I became familiar with Python and its internals.</p>
<p>I really started to &#8216;get&#8217; Python in September 2001. I wrote the white papers at
about this time. Python solved <em>all</em> my programming problems. I rewrote Leo in
Python in about two months! For the first time in my career I was no longer
anxious while programming; it simply isn&#8217;t possible to create bad bugs in
Python. The Python version of Leo was the first officially OpenSoftware version of
Leo. The first functional version of Leo in Python was 0.05 alpha, December 17,
2001.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sourceforge">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">SourceForge</a><a class="headerlink" href="#sourceforge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I registered the Leo project on SourceForge on March 10, 2003. It is certainly
no accident that Leo started a new life shortly thereafter. Prior to SourceForge
my interest in Leo had been waning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="allowing-sentinel-lines-in-external-files">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Allowing sentinel lines in external files</a><a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-sentinel-lines-in-external-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2001 I began to consider using sentinel lines in external files.
Previously I had thought that outline structure must be &#8216;protected&#8217; by remaining
inside .leo files. Accepting the possibility that sentinels might be corrupted
opened vast new design possibilities. In retrospect, problems with sentinel
almost never happen, but that wasn&#8217;t obvious at the time! The result of this
design was known at first as Leo2. That terminology is extinct. I think of
this version as the first version to support &#64;file and automatic tangling
and untangling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="untangling-file-is-easy">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Untangling &#64;file is easy!</a><a class="headerlink" href="#untangling-file-is-easy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The biggest surprise in Leo&#8217;s history was the realization it is <strong>much</strong> easier
to untangle files derived from &#64;file. Indeed, the old tangle code created all
sorts of problems that just disappear when using &#64;file. The new Python version
of Leo became fully operational in early 2002. It was probably about this time
that I chose noweb as Leo&#8217;s preferred markup language. My decision not to
support noweb&#8217;s escape sequences made Leo&#8217;s read code much more robust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-3-x-continuous-improvement">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Leo 3.x: Continuous improvement</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-3-x-continuous-improvement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I spent 2002 taking advantages of Python&#8217;s tremendous power and safety.
Many improvements were at last easy enough to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nested &#64;others directives appeared in 3.2.</li>
<li>Unicode support started in 3.3.</li>
<li>&#64;first and &#64;last appeared in 3.7</li>
<li>&#64;asis and &#64;nosent appeared in 3.8.</li>
<li>Incremental syntax coloring and incremental undo appeared in 3.9.</li>
<li>Paul Paterson created Leo&#8217;s plugin architecture sometime during this period.
Plugins have been a driving force in Leo&#8217;s development because people can
change how Leo works without altering Leo&#8217;s core.</li>
<li>3.12 fixed a huge memory leak.</li>
<li>3.12 Final, the last 3.x version, appeared July 17, 2003.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-0-eliminating-error-recovery">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Leo 4.0: Eliminating error &#8216;recovery&#8217;</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-0-eliminating-error-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In late 2002 and throughout 2003 I worked on an entirely new file format.
4.0 final went out the door October 17, 2003 after almost a year intense
design work trying to improve error recovery scheme used while reading
external files. In the summer of 2003 I realized that orphan and &#64;ignore&#8217;d
nodes must be prohibited in &#64;file trees. With this restriction, Leo
could finally recreate &#64;file trees in outlines using <strong>only</strong> the
information in external files. This made the read code much more robust, and
eliminated all the previous unworkable error recovery schemes. At last Leo
was on a completely firm foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-1-the-debut-of-gnx-s">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Leo 4.1: The debut of gnx&#8217;s</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-1-the-debut-of-gnx-s" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo first used gnx&#8217;s (global node indices) as a foolproof way of associating
nodes in .leo files with nodes in external files. At the time, there was
still intense discussions about protecting the logical consistency of
outlines. &#64;thin was later to solve all those problems, but nobody knew
that then.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-2-complete-at-last">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Leo 4.2: Complete at last</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-2-complete-at-last" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo 4.2 Final went out the door September 20, 2004.
This surely is one of the most significant dates in Leo&#8217;s history:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">This marked the end worries about consistency of outlines and external files:
Leo recreates all essential information from thin external files,
so <em>there is nothing left in the .leo file to get out of synch</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Thin external files use gnx&#8217;s extensively. This simplifies the file format and</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">makes thin external files more cvs friendly.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A sensational scripting plugin showed how to create script buttons.
This has lead to improvements in the Execute Script command and
other significant improvements in Unit testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As if this were not enough, 4.2 marked the &#8216;great divide&#8217; in Leo&#8217;s internal
data structures. Before 4.2, Leo every node in the outline had its own
vnode. This was a big performance problem: clone operations had to
traverse the entire outline! 4.2 represents clones by sharing subtrees.
Changing Leo&#8217;s fundamental data structures while retaining compatibility
with old scripts was engineering work of which the entire Leo community can
be proud. <a class="reference external" href="scripting.html">Scripting Leo with Python</a> tells how the position
class makes this happen.
This was a cooperative effort. Kent Tenney and Bernhard Mulder made
absolutely crucial contributions. Kent pointed out that it is a tnode,
not a vnode that must form the root of the shared data. Bernhard showed
that iterators are the way to avoid creating huge numbers of positions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leo 4.2 marked so many significant changes. I often find it hard to remember
what life with Leo was like before it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-3-settings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Leo 4.3 Settings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-3-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo 4.3 corrected many problems with leoConfig.txt. Instead, Leo gets
settings from one or more leoSettings.leo files. This version also
introduced a way to changed settings using a settings dialog.  However,
the settings dialog proved not to be useful (worse, it inhibited design) and
the settings dialog was retired in Leo 4.4.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-4-the-minibuffer-and-key-bindings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Leo 4.4 The minibuffer and key bindings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-4-the-minibuffer-and-key-bindings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo 4.4 was a year-long effort to incorporate an Emacs-style minibuffer and
related commands into Leo. Thinking in terms of minibuffer commands frees my
thinking. Leo 4.4 also featured many improvements in how keys are bound to
commands, including per-pane bindings and user-defined key-binding modes.</p>
<p>Development on long-delayed projects accelerated after 4.4 final went out the door.
Recent projects include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Controlling syntax coloring with jEdit&#8217;s xml language-description files.</li>
<li>Support for debugging scripts using external debuggers.</li>
<li>Modifying Leo&#8217;s vnodes and tnodes so that Leo&#8217;s data can be used with ZODB.</li>
<li>Using pymacs to write Leo scripts within Emacs.</li>
<li>Using the leoBridge module to embed Leo support in other programs.</li>
<li>Using Leo to run unit tests.</li>

<p>This series of releases featured <strong>hundreds</strong> of improvements.  The highlights were truly significant:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added the leoBridge module. See <a class="reference external" href="leoBridge.html">Embedding Leo with the leoBridge Module</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for &#64;enabled-plugins and &#64;open-with nodes in settings files.</li>
<li>Added support for ZODB. See <a class="reference external" href="zodb.html">Using ZODB with Leo</a>.</li>
<li>Added leoPymacs module. See <a class="reference external" href="emacs.html">Leo and Emacs</a>.</li>
<li>Added perfect import of external files with &#64;auto nodes.</li>
<li>Used the sax parser to .leo files. This allows the format of .leo files to be
expanded easily.</li>
<li>Added support for myLeoSettings.leo.</li>
<li>Supported multiple editors in body pane.</li>
<li>Added the jEdit_colorizer plugin. See <a class="reference external" href="coloring.html">Controlling Syntax Coloring</a>.</li>
<li>Many other new plugins.</li>

<p>This version of Leo featured more significant improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added support for the Qt gui.  This was a major project that
significantly improves the look and feel of Leo.</li>
<li>A file-caching scheme produced spectacular improvements in the
speed of loading Leo outlines.</li>
<li>Added support for &#64;auto-rst nodes. These import reStructuredText (rST) files
so that the files can be &#8220;round-tripped&#8221; without introducing extraneous
changes. This makes Leo a superb environment for using rST.</li>
<li>Added support for &#64;edit nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leo 4.7 accomplishes something I long thought to be impossible: the unification
of vnodes and tnodes. tnodes now longer exist: vnodes contain all data. The Aha
that made this possible is that iterators and positions allow a single node to
appear in more than one place in a tree traversal.</p>
<p>This is one of the most significant developments in Leo&#8217;s history. At last the
endless confusion between vnodes and tnodes is gone. At the most fundamental
level, Leo&#8217;s data structures are as simple as possible. This makes them as
general and as powerful as possible!</p>
<p>This version successfully produced a common code base that can run on both
Python 2.x and Python 3.x.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-4-8-simple-sentinels-better-data-recovery">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Leo 4.8 Simple sentinels &amp; better data recovery</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-4-8-simple-sentinels-better-data-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leo 4.8 simplified Leo&#8217;s sentinels as much as possible.
Leo&#8217;s sentinel lines look very much like Emacs org-mode comment lines,
except for the addition of gnx&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This version also produced a fundamentally important addition to Leo&#8217;s error
recovery. Leo now shows &#8220;Resurrected&#8221; and &#8220;Recovered&#8221; nodes when loading an
outline. These nodes protect against data loss, and also implicitly warn when
unusual data-changing events occur. Creating this scheme is likely the final
chapter in the epic saga of error recovery in Leo.</p>
